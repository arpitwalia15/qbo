  <h1>From AWS to QBO running on IONOS bare metal, OpExx Achieved a 40% Reduction on Total Cost of Ownership</h1>
  <p>This customer story explores the tremendous value that OpExx, a FinOps SaaS provider, gained by leveraging QBO and the IONOS Bare Metal Cloud to deliver its solution. Their journey demonstrates how this combination benefits OpExx by optimizing performance, reducing costs, and enhancing operational simplicity, compared to running on hyperscale public clouds.</p>
  <h2>The Challenge</h2>
  <p>OpExx, a provider of operational efficiency SaaS solutions, needed a robust infrastructure to support its growing customer base. Challenges included:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Cost Management:</strong> Escalating costs on hyperscale public clouds, including high performance data warehouse</li>
  <li><strong>Performance Requirements:</strong> Ensuring low latency and high throughput for real-time data processing and analytics</li>
  <li><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Reducing DevOps overhead to focus on innovation and scaling the SaaS solution</li>
</ul>
  <h2>The Solution</h2>
  <p>OpExx migrated its SaaS operations to a solution built on:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>IONOS Bare Metal Cloud:</strong> Delivering dedicated, high-performance hardware at predictable costs</li>
  <li><strong>QBO:</strong> Simplifying orchestration and enabling a PaaS-like environment on bare metal</li>
  <li><strong>Optimized Architecture:</strong> Designed to scale with OpExx’s SaaS workloads while maintaining cost efficiency and performance</li>
</ul>
  <h2>Implementation</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Deployment on IONOS Bare Metal Cloud:</strong> Replaced hyperscale cloud instances with dedicated bare-metal servers provided by IONOS. Predictable pricing structures eliminated variable fees and simplified financial planning.</li>
  <li><strong>Streamlined Orchestration with QBO:</strong> QBO transformed bare-metal servers into scalable environments for deploying and managing SaaS applications.</li>
  <li><strong>Optimized SaaS Workloads:</strong> Real-time analytics, customer dashboards, and operational tools were fine-tuned to leverage the performance of bare-metal infrastructure.</li>
</ol>
  <h2>Results</h2>
  <h3>1. Cost Savings</h3>
  <p><strong>Reduction in TCO:</strong> OpExx achieved a 40% cost reduction compared to hyperscale cloud expenses due to:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Eliminating egress fees and over-provisioning</li>
  <li>Leveraging efficient resource allocation with QBO</li>
</ul>
  <h3>2. Performance Improvements</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Enhanced Application Responsiveness: Running directly on bare metal reduced latency by 25%, critical for real-time SaaS features like reporting</li>
  <li>Increased Throughput: Dedicated hardware eliminated hypervisor resource contention</li>
</ul>
  <h3>3. Operational Efficiency</h3>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>DevOps Simplification:</strong> QBO’s orchestration reduced manual intervention, freeing OpExx’s team to focus on innovation</li>
  <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Rapid deployment of new SaaS instances to meet growing demand</li>
</ul>
  <h3 class="color-blue">Comparison with Hyperscale Public Cloud</h3>
